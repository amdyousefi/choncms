Prepare application for easy setup, 

Make dev and user guide:

For Developers: 
	1. Checkout chon-web-container
	   - Configure Tomcat in eclipse, deploy the application
	   - Configure OSGi developement with Felix
	   
	2. Checkout plugins
	3. Checkout app-work-dir

	Modify system.properties
	#CHANGE THIS FOR DEVELOPMENT TO POINT TO YOUR plugins dir (usually eclipse workspace)
	commons.configson.resources=/abs/path/to/dev/dir (dir from step 2)
	
	(to load static resource and templates tomcat needs to know their developemt location, usually eclipse workspace)
	
	
	Set Tomcat startup variable
	-Dsystem-properties-dir=/my/path/to/app-work-dir
	(tells the server where is your system.properties - the only required configuration from where all others are loaded)
	

	4. Run Tomcat
	
For Users
1. Download application ...
2. Extract; you should get:
	app-work-dir
	chon.war

3. Deploy chon.war in web container (tested with tomcat 6.0)
4. Set startup variable on server run
    -Dsystem-properties-dir=/abs/path/to/app-work-dir
	(*Make sure in /abs/path/to/app-work-dir there is system.properties file)
	
5. Run the Server
	make sure it works at: http://localhost:8080/chon
	login at: http://localhost:8080/chon/admin.index.do
	 user: admin
	 pass: admin
	
6. Adjust visual aspect of the node, control how they will be shown
 - Modify default template
	app-work-dir/resources/org.chon.cms.template/templates/default
 - Switch to new template
	app-work-dir/config/org.chon.cms.template.json
		defaultTemplate: 'choncms'
	(see app-work-dir/resources/org.chon.cms.template/templates for a list of available tempaltes)
